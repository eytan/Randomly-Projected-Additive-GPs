# Scalable GPs git repo

This repo is a work-in-progress for running experiments related to scalable Gaussian Processes. It is planned to contain code to (1) preprocess many benchmark datasets, (2) implement and run (scalable) Gaussian Process models, primarily using GPyTorch, (3) easily, modularly, and systematically run batches of experiments, and (4) visualize results.
